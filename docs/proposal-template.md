Team name: Bad At Unity

Team members: Patrick Lenga, Hunter Chopp, Matthew Squire

# Introduction
Our project is to make a 2D dungeon crawler game in unity. Using sprites from unity's asset store as the player model and enemies. Our style will be different from a traditional dungeon crawler. 
We will instead place the character in a more modern setting rather than a castle or dungeon. 

Our character's name is "Roberta The Eliminator" who was placed 2000 years into the future with her pet chihuahua Alfred (subject to change if no chihuahua is available). Unpon arrival she was commanded to fight the invading army of "New Korea". With her companion by her side she must battle to get back to her original timeline.

# Anticipated Technologies

Unity software, paint.net (for level design if none available), git. 

# Method/Approach

Our team will be using the scrum route. We will pick tasks on a weekly basis and communicate throughout the process to ensure the completion of each task assigned. 
Also to test each task once it has been completed to ensure no bugs/issues with each implementation.

# Estimated Timeline

Level Design: 2-4 weeks.
AI Implementation: 2-3 Weeks.
Bug Fixing: 1-2 weeks.

# Anticipated Problems

Level design if no assets are available.
Character design if no sprites are available.
Shooting mechanic for both the player and enemy.
AI Implementation.
