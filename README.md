# Bad At Unity 
Our project is to make a 2D dungeon crawler game in unity. Using sprites from unity's asset store as the player model and enemies. Our style will be different from a traditional dungeon crawler. 
We will instead place the character in a more modern setting to better connect with our main audience (Teenagers/Young Adults).
